### How to get your domain added to soggaimages

#### 1

send a dm to tricked#3777 telling him what domain you want added and it should be a [wildcard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_DNS_record) domain

### 2

if you want a [wildcard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_DNS_record) domain added you are going to have to point your name server to vercel's server (tricked will send you which)

if you want just a single subdomain or domain added your gonna have to make a cname record to vercel (tricked will tell which url)

### 3

after all that the bot will be updated to have your domain added to the domain list

if you want it to just be used by you thats fine too just make sure to mention it
